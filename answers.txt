What is a remote repository?
A remote repository is a repository that is a version of a project that is hosted on a network, where other people can work on the same project.

What is the difference between a merge and a rebase? Merge forms a new merge commit on the current branch, while keeping the old branches, while rebase connects the current branch to the end of the main branch, leaving only one branch.
